  <p class="lead">This is the achievement I got so far. If I still have time, I will try to finish Yammer integration in tomorrow, if a week is not five days:).</p>
  <p class="lead">I was trapped by <b>'access-control-allow-origin'</b> at first and spent nearly two days to solve it :( Unfortunately, after I tried everything(even tried all browsers), this problem still there. Then I decided to route X-O requests to server side and let server re-send them. After this problem was neutralized, I found tomcat was not very suitable to host webapps, so I started to learn node.js. After had some study about node.js, I decided to use MEAN stack as my webapp framework. Then started actually to write code for this app:) while learning Angularjs and reviewing JavaScript, JQuery etc.</p>
  <p class="lead">After went through this project at this point, I realized those websites I wrote before are really out-of-date-craps. And thanks for gaving me a chance to do this project, during which I learnt a lot new technologies and refreshed my knowledge about website and webapp construction.</p>
